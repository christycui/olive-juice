# Olive Juice

Built at EthDenver 2024.

Olive Juice allows creators who have registered their content on Story Protocol to identify if, and how, their minted IP has been used by other creators. Starting with remixes posted on Twitter, Olive Juice aims to scale to other platforms where user content is shared.

Through Olive Juice, creators can see how their content is being used, by whom, and determine whether they wish to file a dispute, or potentially even remix the remix! Additionally, Olive Juice will register the derivative IP automatically onto Story Protocol for IP provenance. If they wish, the derivative creators can also claim their registered IP from Olive Juice at a later date.

## How to Use

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
